## What We Do
In Utah, we have over 400 cold cases of missing, murdered, and unidentified deceased individuals. There are several different databases that contain public information on these cases between the state and local agencies as well as nonprofits. These database entries vary from agency to agency - often with missing or incorrect information. We aim to compile and contact those agencies to ensure all pertinent information is available for every database.
## Why We Do It
True crime is a popular media genre and millions of people consume it daily. Several of these cases in Utah are known nationally and even internationally, sometimes even connected to infamous serial killers. I'd like to help get the focus back on the names that matter - these individuals.
